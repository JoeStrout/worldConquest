Game flow:
1. Title Screen (image, music)

	- New Game: go to 3
2. Instructions (image, or several); then go to 1
3. Game Setup

		(inc. several standard maps: World, Middle Earth, etc.)
	- play options
		- fast AI turns
		- sound/music volume
	- Begin (go to 4), Cancel (go to 1)
4. Gameplay
	- pause/help: show brief help
	- Esc: confirm, then go to 1
	- complete game: go to 5
5. Post-game scene
	- show winner (with fireworks?)

We should also spruce up that map editor, and leave it in there as something for players to find.  Right now it breaks the maps into quadrants; instead we should have it save complete maps.
